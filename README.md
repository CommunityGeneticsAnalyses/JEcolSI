Journal of Ecology Special Issue on Ecological-Evolutionary Dynamics

----Ours----

A central aim of community genetics is to determine how plant genotype influences dependent species, whole communities and ecosystem processes.  Studies have shown that plant genotype can significantly affect or define different community types (e.g., soil microbial decomposers, mycorrhizae, endophytes, pathogens, arthropods), but no study has examined how these diverse communities are associated with one another and how such correlated communities could interact with their individual plants to affect evolution in a community context.  Here we use long-term common garden studies of the diverse fungal communities supported by different plant genotypes to explore the ecological and evolutionary implications of community associations. 


----Special Issue Summary-----

We envision a special issue covering the following topics: 
1. Phenotypic plasticity and genetic mosaicism, and their influence on eco-evolutionary 
dynamics 
2. Commonalities and differences in eco-evolutionary mechanisms between plants and 
animals 
3. Complex plant life histories and eco-evolutionary population dynamics 
4. Soil-microbial and plant-fungal eco-evolutionary dynamics 
5. Eco-evolutionary feedbacks within and beyond plant communities 
6. Ecosystem level eco-evolutionary feedbacks mediated via plants and soil microbes

Dear authors,

I wanted to e-mail you with the great news that Journal of Ecology has approved our special issue. We still need to work out the timeline, but it is currently envisaged that the special issue will come out in Spring 2015. So, if please go ahead and start writing! Rob and I will let you know the timeline when we clarify it with Journal of Ecology's managing editor.

Sincerely,

Rich Shefferson
